After completion and installation of the canvas, the panels would not adhere to the wall, so they had to be removed and reinstalled.&nbsp; New lighting fixtures that blocked the view of the murals had to be removed.&nbsp; An ambitious United Press reporter, however, caused the most furror -- he noticed the young girl holding an envelope and decided to have its obscure Eskimo dialect translated.&nbsp; According to the artist, the meaning is:&nbsp; \"To the people of Puerto Rico, our friends!&nbsp; Go ahead, let us change Chiefs.&nbsp; That alone can make us equal and free.\" (Letter from Kent to New York Times 9/17/37.)&nbsp; In 1937, Puerto Rico was making news because of its growing movement toward independence. Protests about the \"revolutionary\" tone of the letter were being received from major officials in the Puerto Rican Government, as well as angry American citizens who suggested that Kent's mural suffer the same fate as Diego Rivera's panels in Rockefeller Center.&nbsp; Kent defended his mural in frequent letters to the newspapers.&nbsp; He suggested that the idea of change does not imply revolution or violence.&nbsp; Furthermore, he mentioned that the \"chiefs\" might refer to a Governor, or any of the men or women in Government.&nbsp; He saw his message as \"stirring and beautiful a message as can be sent from anywhere at any time in history from one people to another.&nbsp; That is the American message of good will to a people in its aspirations for freedom.\" (Letter from Kent to New York Times 9/17/37.)&nbsp; The number of African Americans represented in the mural elicited further protests, calling for the addition of more white males in the panel.&nbsp; These complaints were ignored.&nbsp; Kent offered to replace the wording of the letter with a speech by Lincoln, but since there was no agreement on which excerpt to use, the artist refused to accomodate the US Postal Service, which then withheld payment.&nbsp; The end result was that it stayed as it was."}],"ObjectsPeople":[{"id":2663,"objectId":1083,"personId":3331,"role":"Associated Program","displayName":"New Deal Fine Arts","institution":"New Deal Fine Arts"},{"lastName":"Kent","id":25860,"objectId":1083,"personId":1735,"role":"Artist","displayName":"Rockwell Kent","firstName":"Rockwell"}],"medium":"oil on canvas","primaryImage":"/FA571/Carol Highsmith/Kent,R.FA571-A.CH2011.jpg","id":1083,"title":"MAIL SERVICE IN THE TROPICS","classification":"painting","artistRelatedObjects":[{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1937","objectNumber":"FA571-B","medium":"oil on canvas","primaryImage":"/FA571/Carol Highsmith/Kent,R.FA571-B.CH2011.jpg","id":1084,"title":"MAIL SERVICE IN THE ARCTIC","classification":"painting","dimensions":"7' x 13'6\"","artist":"Rockwell Kent"},{"region":"Non-Federal Repository","displayDate":"ca.1935","objectNumber":"FA21128","id":15367,"classification":"print","artist":"Rockwell Kent"}],"siteRelatedObjects":[{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1937","objectNumber":"FA566-G","medium":"wood","primaryImage":"/FA566/Carol Highsmith/Derujinsky,G.FA566-G.CH2011.jpg","id":956,"title":"GIDEON GRANGER, FORMER POSTMASTER GENERAL","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"2'10\"","artist":"Gleb W.
