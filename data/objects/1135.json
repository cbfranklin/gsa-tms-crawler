The right vertical passage depicts children at play and school work.&nbsp; This right passage is painted in a much more vibrant palette.&nbsp; The central figures of the piece, the figure of an adult behind a child, have arms extended as if choosing between the left and right passages.<BR><BR>PLAQUE TEXT (FALL 2003):<BR>The bisected composition of Contemporary Justice and the Child compares the quality of life of children in two differing societies.&nbsp; At the center of the mural stands a mother with her child.&nbsp; She hesitantly lets go of her son's grasp as she sends him into an uncertain future.&nbsp; Released from his mother's protective embrace, the child stands vulnerable as he faces two possible outcomes.&nbsp; What path will society enable him to take?&nbsp; The planned road, which begins at the bottom center and advances in a counter-clockwise direction, encourages creativity and vitality in the child.&nbsp; An enlarged pair of hands holding a drafting triangle and compass symbolizes the planning of a society that provides an educational environment where children may thrive both mentally and physically.&nbsp; The other path, located along the left side of the mural, portrays the harsh conditions of a world where justice does not prevail.&nbsp; This is an underprivileged world where children are subjected to grueling factory labor and severe malnourishment.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Shimin received public acclaim as a champion of social justice, as evidenced in his mural's condemnation of child labor.&nbsp; Though Shimin's subject matter seems markedly distanced from the lives of American children in the 21st century, one must remember that factory labor was a reality for countless children (especially immigrant children) less than a century ago.&nbsp; While a number of regulatory laws were passed on the state and local level during the late 1800s, such laws were often ignored and children continued to be exploited.&nbsp; During the early decades of the 1900s, child labor reform became a popular social movement, however, the practice was still legal when Shimin received his commission for the mural in 1936.&nbsp; It was not until the Fair Labor Standards Act, passed by Congress in 1938, that the federal government officially outlawed the employment of underaged children.<BR><BR>Symeon Shimin (1902-1984) was born in Astrakhan, Russia, and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1912.&nbsp; In addition to his federal commission for Contemporary Justice and the Child, Shimin also completed a mural series for the United States Post Office in Tonawanda, New York.&nbsp; His works can be found in the collections of the Walter Chrysler Art Museum in Detroit, Michigan, Biro Bijan in Russia, the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and Fairleigh Dickenson University in Rutherford, New Jersey.<BR><BR>"},{"id":33328,"objectId":1135,"textType":"Medium","textEntry":"Tempera on canvas"}],"ObjectsPeople":[{"id":2703,"objectId":1135,"personId":3331,"role":"Associated Program","displayName":"New Deal Fine Arts","institution":"New Deal Fine Arts"},{"lastName":"Shimin","id":25912,"objectId":1135,"personId":126,"role":"Artist","displayName":"Symeon Shimin","firstName":"Symeon"}],"medium":"tempera","primaryImage":"/FA551/Carol Highsmith/Shimin, S- FA551.CH2007.jpg","id":1135,"title":"CONTEMPORARY JUSTICE & CHILD","classification":"painting","siteRelatedObjects":[{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA4073-A","medium":"limestone","id":18419,"classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"24\" x 38\"","artist":"Anthony Di Lorenzo"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA1037-A","medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-A.CH2007.jpg","id":1023,"title":"INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"48\" x 84\" x 1-1/2\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1935","objectNumber":"FA546-B","medium":"oil on canvas","primaryImage":"/FA546/Carol Highsmith/Kroll, L- FA546-B.CH2007.jpg","id":402,"title":"JUSTICE DEFEATED","classification":"painting","dimensions":"7'9\" x 21'8\"","artist":"Leon Kroll"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA1037-B","medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-B.CH2007.jpg","id":1024,"title":"MASTERY OF CRIME","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"48\" x 84\" x 1-1/2\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA541-E","medium":"plaster","id":2622,"title":"CANON LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"36\" x 20\"","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA541-D","medium":"plaster","id":2621,"title":"CANON LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"36\" x 20\"","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1936","objectNumber":"FA539-A","medium":"oil on canvas","primaryImage":"/FA539/Carol Highsmith/Curry, J- FA539-A.02.CH2007.jpg","id":348,"title":"LAW VERSUS MOB RULE","classification":"painting","dimensions":"7'6\" x 20'","artist":"John Steuart Curry"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1935","objectNumber":"FA545-A","medium":"aluminum","primaryImage":"/FA545/Carol Highsmith/Jennewein, C- FA545-A.02.CH2007.jpg","id":401,"title":"MAJESTY OF JUSTICE","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"12'6\" x 41\"","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1935","objectNumber":"FA544","medium":"aluminum","id":287,"title":"TEMPERANCE","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"each: 36 x 19 in. maximum diameter (91.4 x 48.3 cm)","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA893","medium":"plaster","id":2437,"title":"THE TWELVE PHYSIOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRIAL REGIONS OF THE NATIONAL DOMAIN","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"each: 48 x 88 x 1 1/2 in.
