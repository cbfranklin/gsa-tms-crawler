Writing on the relief reads:&nbsp; \"Mastery of Crime\".&nbsp; Although most information states that all sculptures for the building were designed in the studio of C. Paul Jennewein, he attributes these four works to Carl Ludwig Schmitz in a letter dated July 5, 1972 to Karel Yasko. Dimensions include frames.&nbsp; One of four plaster relief panels.&nbsp; The title appears in raised capital letters on the relief plane.&nbsp; There is no artist's signature.<BR><BR>Plaque text:<BR>Originally located over the entrances to the Attorney General's office and the Solicitor General's office, these panels were relocated two years after their installation.&nbsp; The Department of Treasury's Section of Painting and Sculpture, with the consent of the architects of the Department of Justice building, requested the move in order to make room for a series of murals completed by Henry Varnum Poor in 1936.&nbsp; Schmitz modeled the four panels on designs submitted by Carl Paul Jennewein, the artist responsible for overseeing all of the sculptural design in the Department of Justice building.<BR><BR>The two panels originally placed over the entrance to the Attorney General's office, were Interpretation of Law and Investigation of Truth.&nbsp; In Interpretation of Law a seated contemporary man receives the teachings and wisdom of Moses and Solon, two ancient law makers, while Justice stands ready to record the new interpretation.&nbsp; This panel symbolizes how past sources of the legal tradition can influence modern interpretations.&nbsp; Investigation of Truth presents Truth as mirrored by Justice, who triumphs over the figure of falsehood who holds her deceitful mask aloft as she turns away.&nbsp; Defense of the Public and Master of Crime were the two panels removed from the Solicitor General's entrance.&nbsp; The idea of Defense of the Public is communicated through the protective female figure of Justice who stands alert, guarding an ideal family grouping.&nbsp; Master of Crime depicts Justice as a stern female figure holding an eagle, a symbol of power and victory since Roman times.&nbsp; She presides over three struggling figures in various states of imprisonment, motioning for them to move on to the jailhouse pictured in the background."}],"ObjectsPeople":{"lastName":"Schmitz","id":25801,"objectId":1024,"personId":2333,"role":"Artist","displayName":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz","firstName":"Carl Ludwig"},"medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-B.CH2007.jpg","id":1024,"title":"MASTERY OF CRIME","classification":"sculpture","artistRelatedObjects":[{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA1037-D","medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-D.CH2007.jpg","id":1112,"title":"DEFENSE OF THE PUBLIC","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"48\" x 84\" x 1-1/2\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA1037-A","medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-A.CH2007.jpg","id":1023,"title":"INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"48\" x 84\" x 1-1/2\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1938","objectNumber":"FA559","medium":"limestone","id":721,"title":"FOREIGN TRADE","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"6'9\" x 12'3\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA1037-C","medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-C.CH2007.jpg","id":1111,"title":"INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"48\" x 84\" x 1-1/2\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1936","objectNumber":"FA587","medium":"aluminum","primaryImage":"/FA587/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz,C.FA587.CH2011.jpg","id":964,"title":"CITY DELIVERY CARRIER, 1863","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"4' x 2' x 1'6\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"}],"siteRelatedObjects":[{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA4073-A","medium":"limestone","id":18419,"classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"24\" x 38\"","artist":"Anthony Di Lorenzo"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA1037-A","medium":"plaster","primaryImage":"/FA1037/Carol Highsmith/Schmitz, C- FA1037-A.CH2007.jpg","id":1023,"title":"INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"48\" x 84\" x 1-1/2\"","artist":"Carl Ludwig Schmitz"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1935","objectNumber":"FA546-B","medium":"oil on canvas","primaryImage":"/FA546/Carol Highsmith/Kroll, L- FA546-B.CH2007.jpg","id":402,"title":"JUSTICE DEFEATED","classification":"painting","dimensions":"7'9\" x 21'8\"","artist":"Leon Kroll"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA541-E","medium":"plaster","id":2622,"title":"CANON LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"36\" x 20\"","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA541-D","medium":"plaster","id":2621,"title":"CANON LAW","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"36\" x 20\"","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1936","objectNumber":"FA539-A","medium":"oil on canvas","primaryImage":"/FA539/Carol Highsmith/Curry, J- FA539-A.02.CH2007.jpg","id":348,"title":"LAW VERSUS MOB RULE","classification":"painting","dimensions":"7'6\" x 20'","artist":"John Steuart Curry"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1935","objectNumber":"FA545-A","medium":"aluminum","primaryImage":"/FA545/Carol Highsmith/Jennewein, C- FA545-A.02.CH2007.jpg","id":401,"title":"MAJESTY OF JUSTICE","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"12'6\" x 41\"","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1935","objectNumber":"FA544","medium":"aluminum","id":287,"title":"TEMPERANCE","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"each: 36 x 19 in. maximum diameter (91.4 x 48.3 cm)","artist":"Carl Paul Jennewein"},{"region":"Region 11","displayDate":"1933","objectNumber":"FA893","medium":"plaster","id":2437,"title":"THE TWELVE PHYSIOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRIAL REGIONS OF THE NATIONAL DOMAIN","classification":"sculpture","dimensions":"each: 48 x 88 x 1 1/2 in.
