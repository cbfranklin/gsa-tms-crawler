Although his commission was well received by the Section of Painting and Sculpture, the hanging of the 20 panels was delayed due to the objections of a Roman Catholic cleric.&nbsp; Sterne believed these to be his finest work and was incensed at the charges against the panel \"Cruelty\".&nbsp; The cleric maintained that the panel appeared to have clergy aiding in acts of cruelty rather than halting trial by ordeal. Through the efforts of Edward Bruce (Treasury Department) and Biddle the affair was resolved and the paintings were eventually hung.
