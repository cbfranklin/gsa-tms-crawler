Since lime plaster dries in approximately a day, artists have to apply fresh plaster every morning to the area of the fresco that they plan to complete that day.&nbsp; Hence, a finished fresco had a puzzle-like configuration of colored plaster patches.&nbsp; Each individual patch is slightly visible in the finished painting and is typically called a giornata, or&nbsp; \"one day's work.\"&nbsp; The fresco painting technique dates back to Antiquity and was used continuously through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, particularly in Italy.&nbsp; The technique was revived in the United States in the thirties, due mainly to the influence of Mexican Muralist Diego Rivera, who is generally credited with reintroducing fresco painting into modern art.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial\">Poor was assisted by his stepdaughter Anne in the execution of the Justice frescoes and she also collaborated with him on a series of murals at the Department of the Interior.&nbsp; She was responsible for the preparation of the wet plaster and its application on the walls.

Donaldson, the first FBI chemist, who served the Bureau from 1934 to 1957.&nbsp; The man inspecting a test tube is Charles A. Appel, who headed the first FBI laboratory from 1924 to 1949.&nbsp; The seated man looking through a microscope is Donald J. Parson, who during his career in the FBI from 1934 to 1961 was an Assistant Director of the FBI Laboratory as well as Assistant to the Director.&nbsp; The left panel, titled Antitrust, illustrates the effects of unfair business practices on the average citizen.&nbsp; The third scene, Kidnapping, depicts an extremely topical subject, as in 1932 in response to the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, Congress passed a federal kidnapping statute which helped solidify the FBI as the nation's premiere law enforcement agency.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Crime Prevention:&nbsp; Anti Trust.&nbsp; Woman with child, buying produce; stock exchange in background.<BR>Crime Prevention:&nbsp; Bureau of Investigation.&nbsp; Federal Bureau of Investigation crime lab with three men.<BR>Crime Prevention:&nbsp; Kidnapping.&nbsp; Airplane, three pilots on left; three men on left, two carrying body.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial\"><BR>The three frescoes shown here depict the activities of the Bureau of Prisons, specifically the redemptive cycle of Imprisonment, Vocational Training, and Release.&nbsp; The Bureau was established in 1930 to provide more progressive and humane care for Federal inmates among other functions, something that the Training panel suggests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial\">Bureau of Prisons:&nbsp; Vocational Training.&nbsp; Industrial scene.<BR>Bureau of Prisons:&nbsp; Imprisonment.&nbsp; Man in handcuffs.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial\">Bureau of Prisons:&nbsp; Release.&nbsp; Woman embracing man who is leaving prison.<BR><BR>Henry Varnum Poor (1888-1970) completed twelve fresco panels for the Department of Justice that illustrate the various activities and functions of the Department and its subsidiary branches.&nbsp; The left panel relates to the 1939 Tennessee Valley Authority Act, which lowered electrical rates and thus allowed for the widespread use of electrical power, especially in rural areas. The eagle painted above the door is unusual in that the eagle faces to the left, traditionally the side that symbolizes war through the arrows it clutches in its left talon.&nbsp; In more contemporary images, the eagle is always depicted facing right, towards the olive branch held in the right talon, the symbol of peace, a practice instituted by President Harry S. Truman.&nbsp; The third panel contains a scene depicting a government lawyer, believed to represent Attorney General Homer S. Cummings (1933-1939), arguing the celebrated Gold Clause Cases of 1935 before the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Also present are Justice Louis Brandeis (1916 to 1939) on the left, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (1910 to 1916 and 1930 to 1941) in the center, and Justice James C.
